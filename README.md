# tictactoe
A Java terminal tic-tac-toe game where you play against the computer. 
The computer has two difficulties: easy, where it's moves are random, and hard, where it uses a min/max algorithm which will always win or tie.

The LeoTicTacToe.java file has the main method that will run in your IDE terminal.
The program currently only runs in the Eclipse IDE for unkown reasons.
There are comments throughout the two files which explain how it all works.
