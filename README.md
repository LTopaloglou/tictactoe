# tictactoe
A Java terminal tic-tac-toe game where you play against the computer. 
The computer has two difficulties: easy, where it's moves are random, and hard, where it uses a min/max algorithm which will always win or tie.

I made this project in Spring 2020 for an assignment in my computer science class.
The LeoTicTacToe.java file has the main method so run that in your IDE to play.
There are comments throughout the two files which explain how it all works.
